###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I have used git prior to starting DBC and what we have been working on has been more of a review. So although I wasn't really struggling with anything this has really helped to solidify my knowledge base.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Having someone to talk things over with was actually really helpful. Typically I have always worked on my own and have had to resort to Google when I get stuck. Using the git fetch and git merge method in the GPS really helped clarify what git pull does.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I guess the only real question that came up was the difference between the git fetch and git merge method versus the git pull method.

###What still confuses you about git?
Again, this has been more of a review and although I don't know everything about git, this was really helpful in re-enforcing the concepts I already knew.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Going into the session I was incredibly nervous. I joke around a lot to cover the fact that I am an extreme introvert, so this and peer pairing has really been something I was dreading. That being said, I found the session to be incredibly helpful. Having someone, even if they only know as much as yourself, to bounce ideas off was great. Everyone has a slightly different approach and being able to step outside of your own little box and see a problem from a different perspective was great. I was also really appreciative of the fact that we are all in this together and struggle with the same issues. It makes be feel less like I'm stuck on an island!
