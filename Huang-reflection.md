####What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was not entirely sure about `git fetch` and `git merge` prior to the GPS session. This was probably due to our use of `git push` during previous challenges over the `git fetch/merge` process. Nevertheless, this session with Todd and Katy helped clarify the uses of `git fetch` and `git merge` for me.

####What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The concept of `git fetch` and `git merge` were clarified for me. I understood what `fetch` did before, but wasn't so sure about `merge` in the context of fetch/merge. I'm glad I was able to discuss this with Todd and our guide Katy. Katy also mentioned that most of the time developers will opt to use `git push` over using `git fetch` and `git merge`

Todd also shared with me a great tip for quick add/commits with `git commit -am "message"` which will actually do `git add` for you before doing the commit. This is great to know when I might want to do faster add/commits.

####What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I mainly asked clarifying questions if I was unsure of something and wanted a second opinion. For example, when we were discussing best practices for commit comments, I wanted to check with Katy and Todd if the imperative form was the best way to write comments. We had a discussion about it and looked it up to confirm. It was helpful to have these discussions so that I could solidify these concepts in my head.

Also, Todd and I were on the hangouts group before the scheduled time so we were also able to get to know one another a bit more before the GPS started. We are both based out of the bay area, so it was nice to know more about each other before we started the GPS.

####What still confuses you about git?

I think I feel fairly comfortable with git now, especially after this pairing session. I'm sure there will be more concepts that I will have to learn about in the future!

####How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I thought my first experience pairing in a GPS was a lot of fun! I had a great time working with Todd and swapping between the driver/navigator roles with him. The GPS went smoothly and we were able to finish the challenge without too much trouble.

Todd and I discussed git extensively and clarified concepts that were used in the challenged. I'm glad we were able to spend the time to break down each git concept during the session. It was helpful to have Katy there when we had certain questions about the challenge or wanted to clarify specific concepts.
